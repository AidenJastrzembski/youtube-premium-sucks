i just made this so it would be easier to use on my windows machine

this way, i can just have the executable and not need python on my gaming / editing machine.

to be honest i made this at 1am and now that im looking back i could have just used the ytdlb executable
to begin with, but now its like 1% easier to use so thats an engineering W.
